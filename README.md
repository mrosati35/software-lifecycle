# CS250 Software Development Lifecycle

The documents in this repo describe a notional Scrum process that would have been undertaken
in the production of the SNHU Travel application.

The most important part of any software project is to understand the user's needs. We must
work with the customers and get them to describe those needs, we must accurately capture those
requirements, and we must remain focused on implementing software that meets those needs. One
of the best ways to do this is with user stories. Talking about the software with its prospective
users helps us to understand that, as such a user, they want to perform particular actions with
the software so they can achieve their business goals. This is the format of a user story. They
are written in the first person so that they remain personal and tangible. We identify the class
of user or stakeholder that is concerned with the user story because different kinds of users might
want different things from a feature that seems otherwise the same. We identify the behavior (not
the specific implementation) that the user wants. And we identify the business goal they are trying
to achieve because this helps us devise and perform appropriate acceptance tests.

When I develop programs as part of a Scrum team, I am working every day with my team not only to
ensure that I'm delivering on the user stories I've taken on and committed to completing by the
end of the sprint, but I'm also making myself available to help my teammates with their stories
if they find that they need help. Likewise, if one of my user stories proves to be more difficult
or more complex than I'd imagined, I'm not going to just "work harder" and "hope" I can get it done
in time. Instead, I'll raise the flag and ask the team for help as soon as I recognized the
difficulty. This is the purpose of the daily scrum: making sure that everyone is pulling together
to achieve the sprint goal, and that if anyone needs help, they get it. In Scrum, we succeed and
fail as a team.

Being a good team member in software development involves some of the elements described above:
being willing to help others and being willing to ask for help yourself are important. It's also
important that no team member is a specialist. If a team member finds, perhaps as a result of
personnel changes or past experience, that they are the only person who can work on a particular
piece of the code, it's that team member's responsibility to spread that knowledge around to the
rest of the team--perhaps by pair-programming or by outright instruction. Not only does this protect
the team from the specialist becoming unavailable through illness, distraction, or human resources
activity, but it means that other members of the team can help swarm onto that specialist's tasks
when something proves difficult. It prevents that person's siloed knowledge from being a liability.
As good team members, we also don't just accept the work we're handed. In fact, we're not "handed"
work at all. Instead, we work with the product owner and the rest of the team to make sure that we
understand the goal of the sprint and of each user story, we make only those promises we have a high
certainty of fulfilling, and if we can't do what's been asked, we have the courage to stand up and
say so. We don't just say "no," though; we describe what it'll take, in terms of added time or
reduced scope, to be able to say "yes."
